In recent years, an irrational phenomenon in financial markets is 
grabbing the attention of behavioral economists: the **disposition effect**. 
Firstly discovered by H. Shefrin and M. Statman (1985), the disposition 
effect consists in the realization that investors are more likely to sell 
an asset when it is gaining value compared to when it is losing value. 
A phenomenon which is closely related to sunk costs’ bias, diminishing 
sensitivity, and loss aversion.  

From 1985 until now, the disposition effect has been documented in US 
retail stock investors as well as in foreign retail investors and even 
among professionals and institutions. By the time, it is a well-established 
fact that the disposition effect is a real behavioral anomaly that 
strongly influences the final profits (or losses) of investors. 
Furthermore, being able to correctly capture these irrational behaviors 
timely is even more important in periods of high financial volatility 
as nowadays.  

The presentation focuses on the new **dispositionEffect R package** that 
allows to quickly evaluate the presence of disposition effect’s 
behaviors of an investor based solely on his transactions and the market 
prices of the traded assets. A simple step-by-step practical guide 
is presented to understand how to effectively use all the implemented 
functionalities. Finally, since financial data may be potentially huge 
in size, efficiency concerns are discussed and the parallelized versions 
of the functions are shown.
